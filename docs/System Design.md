## What's covered in this document?
This document will provide a brief overview of the system architecture for the CompFiguration proof of concept web backend application and highlight and explain key design decisions. Various high-level topics will be covered; including DevOps, framework choices, database configuration and a holistic system design diagram. 

This document will not cover the code structure for individual elements of the system, any specific information regarding system details such as IP addresses and login details, nor provide contribution guidelines. 

The R&D process is inherently iterative and, as such, the current state of the system may not always match that of the system design diagram. The developers shall endeavour to ensure that the system design document remains aligned with the current state of the system, however, this is not always possible. An accurate record of the current state of the system can be obtained through a list of Git commits.
